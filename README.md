## `AIR CANVAS`
Developed for communicating a concept or presenting an idea in the real-world space. Air canvas makes all easy to the user. With AIR-CANVAS we
present the thought of the increased reality material for data representation. This is past the customary void (white),rectangular, and level dimensional material seen in customary data representation. The venture proposed in a Python 3.6 and it utilizes the exceptionally well known OpenCV
library. OpenCV is a PC vision and AI programming library that incorporates numerous normal picture examination calculations that will assist us with building custom, savvy register vision application.

## `SKY SCRIPT`
The SkyScript project is an innovative endeavor that combines the capabilities of computer vision, handwriting recognition, and online learning to create a unique and efficient educational tool. The project revolves around the concept of an "air canvas," where a teacher can write or draw in the air using a marker. The movements of the marker are tracked and captured using OpenCV, creating a digital representation of the content.

The primary objective of the Skyscript project is to enhance online learning experiences. By utilizing the air canvas, teachers gain the ability to visually explain concepts directly in front of a camera, as if they were writing on a physical whiteboard. Simultaneously, the project employs handwritten character recognition techniques to transform the air-drawn content into digital text.

This technological fusion holds significant potential in various educational settings. In a virtual classroom environment, teachers can create visual explanations in real-time, bridging the gap between physical and online teaching. The captured content is then processed through the handwritten character recognition system, enabling the automatic conversion of the air-drawn text into digital format.

One of the standout features of the Skyscript project is its potential to revolutionize note-taking. As teachers interact with the air canvas, their explanations are not only visually transmitted but also instantaneously transformed into written text. This digital text can be seamlessly shared with students, eliminating the need for manual transcription and enhancing the overall learning experience.


Currently the roject is in the building stage wherein the data is collected from the canvas and passed to the machine learning model for aking predictions. The accuracy of the model is below average but efforts are being made to minimize the error

### Algorithms Used
- OpenCV for Air Canvas
- Neural Networks for Handwritten Character Recognition

### Methodolgy
- Handwritten text written onto the canvas is taken and preprocessed
- The proprocessed image is passed onto the ML model for Predicting the handwriiten character and simultaneously converting it into digital text

### Conclusion
The SkyScript project leverages the power of computer vision, handwriting recognition, and online learning to create an air canvas that facilitates real-time visual explanations for educational purposes. By allowing teachers to write and draw in the air, the project offers a dynamic teaching tool. Moreover, the integrated handwritten character recognition system converts the air-drawn content into digital text, enhancing accessibility and note-taking. Ultimately, the Skyscript project has the potential to reshape online education by making virtual teaching more interactive and engaging for both educators and students.
